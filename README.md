For my Spring Semester of 2024, I decided to recreate the classic staples Easy Button as a desktop application. You hit the button and it says,
"that was easy". However, I also wanted to give it some customization, such as the button color and the sound effects. As I become a better programmer, I intend to release new versions of this app and target more platforms.
Stay tuned!!!
